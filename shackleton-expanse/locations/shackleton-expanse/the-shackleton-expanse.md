## An Unexplored Territory
Far from the heart of the Federation lies the Shackleton Expanse, a massive area of space deep within the Beta Quadrant. Informally named after the renowned ancient  Earth explorer Ernest Shackleton, the Expanse has, remained largely unexplored. 

Few resources have been committed to exploring the Expanse. Until now, Starfleet preferred to focus on higher-priority regions closer to home. With the end of the war and several years to recover behind the Federation, exploration has become a renewed priority.

We have no reliable intelligence reports to suggest that either the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Star Empire have bothered to send reconnaissance ships or probes into the Expanse. Our Klingon allies apparently have no survey data to share, and the Romulan science corps is unwilling to part with any data they may have

## Data on the Expanse
What little we do have:
- Patchwork of probe telemetry
- A hodgepodge of brand new colonies just now breaking ground on the nearest systems.
- Long range sensor scans
- Unreliable data
- Stories from independent colonists and their crews who have traveled through the Expanse over the years.

 Surveys and personal logs from independent traders are rife with unsubstantiated reports of subspace interference, electromagnetic waveforms, and tetryonic storms.
 
No known sentient species has claimed to be from a world within the Expanse. It's unknown why this might be.

## Starbase 364 - Narendra Station
- Built in tribute to the Klingon colonists who were massacred during a Romulan sneak attack against the Narendra III outpost in 2344, the starbase also serves as a reminder of the pivotal shift in Klingon-Federation relations that assault caused.
- Now Narendra Station has become the foremost outpost for Federation colonization into the Shackleton Expanse.
