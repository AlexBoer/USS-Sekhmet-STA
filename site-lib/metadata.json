While the 2380s have been a time of unprecedented peace and cooperation, it left Klingons restless and with no one to fight. In 2390, several missteps have signaled to the Klingons that there is weakness and dishonor in Starfleet.\nRomulans Throughout the 2380s, the Romulans were left terrified of the Federation, thinking that Starfleet could be capable of anything. But that changed after the Hobus supernova. Now, the Romulans are splintered into factions, many of whom blame the Federation for what happened.\nCardassians have almost recovered from the Dominion attack and are now working on an tentative alliance with the Federation. Bajorans are leading the way to this cooperation and the situation is not unlike the early days of peace between the Federation and Klingon Empire.\nFerengis have undergone a massive cultural shift: lying and scamming is seen as unprofitable and there is a massive effort still to repair their damaged reputation in the Galaxy. Still, some small factions wish to return to the old ways and are seeking new fools to scam on new frontiers.\nBorg are quiet, but everyone is still on edge about them.\nThe Dominion is closely guarded against, but individuals are allowed in after checking in at DS9.\nThe Federation is at the height of its power and most opponents have been allied with or defeated. The return of Voyager inspired a new age of exploration and Narendra Station was founded. But since then, cracks have started to form in the Federation's pristine reputation and internal strife has become apparent. The adventure starts in the year 2390, 4 years after the Hobus supernova that destroyed the Romulus home world and to Earth, and 16 years after the conclusion of the Dominion War. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.By 2390, the Romulans regard the Federation with a colder, more calculating eye. Their traditional arrogance has cooled, but not out of newfound respect .They have come to see the Federation not as naïve idealists, but as something far more dangerous: idealists who are willing to betray their own ideals when pushed hard enough.The revelations about Section 31’s role in ending the Dominion War, previously dismissed as Federation disinformation, are now widely accepted among Romulan intelligence circles. The logic is chilling to them, but also strangely familiar. A Starfleet captain orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan senator, and the Tal Shiar missed it. Starfleet mined the Bajoran wormhole without preamble, forced the hand of the Dominion, and executed a campaign that devastated enemy supply lines with brutal efficiency. Even the unthinkable happened: the Federation forged a war coalition not only with the Klingon Empire but eventually with Romulus itself, all under the command of Starfleet officers. To Romulan strategists, this was not weakness. It was adaptability cloaked in virtue, and it was alarming.The Hobus supernova only deepened the wound. Though Ambassador Spock’s efforts were noble, and though the Federation initially promised to lead a vast evacuation effort, what followed was a betrayal of staggering proportions. In Romulan eyes, the Federation left them to die stranded in the ruins of their empire, abandoned by the very ally who claimed moral superiority.Worse still, the synth attacks on Mars revealed internal Federation instability. The mighty utopia was not immune to sabotage, nor was it able to safeguard its own infrastructure in the hour of need. When the Federation retracted from the evacuation, citing logistical failures and internal threats, the message to Romulus was clear: when tested, the Federation breaks.What remains of the Romulan government now engages with the Federation not out of trust, but out of necessity. The official relationship continues with joint research projects, including one involving a Borg Cube. But these are cautious engagements, constantly monitored by rival factions within the disintegrated Romulan state. The Senate is weak. The old command structure fractured. Regional power bases, led by admirals, governors, or Tal Shiar remnants, now vie for control in a slow-burning conflict that historians are beginning to call the Second Sundering. It is a quiet Warring States period, fought more in cloak and sabotage than open batte, for now.The Neutral Zone still exists, in name and in function. The Treaty of Algeron remains technically intact. But trade is limited, and trust is scarce. For the time being, the Romulans focus inward: rebuilding power, reassessing their place in a galaxy where former allies may yet prove more dangerous than old enemies.Relations between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets are growing tense once again. While the alliance forged in the fires of the Dominion War remains intact, recent events have shaken the perception of the Federation within the High Council and across many of the Great Houses. The synth attacks on Mars (and the Federation’s subsequent abandonment of the Romulan evacuation) have cast a long shadow. To many Klingons, it was not only a strategic failure but a moral collapse: a betrayal born of cowardice and bureaucracy.The Federation, once respected for its resolve in battle and unwavering commitment to its ideals, now appears to some as weak, dishonorable, and lost. Where once Klingon warriors admired the discipline and tenacity of Starfleet, there is now open skepticism. If the Federation would turn its back on its allies, what honor is there in such a partnership?Even so, the political and economic bonds between the two powers run deep. The Klingon Empire is now heavily reliant on Federation dilithium imports to maintain its fleet and economy. War with the Federation would be disastrous, not just on the battlefield, but in the homeworlds, in the markets, and in the halls of power. For all their grievances, most Klingon leaders recognize that open conflict would tear the Empire apart as much as it would harm the Federation.This has created a dangerous contradiction in Klingon society. The blood runs hot. Young warriors, eager for combat and glory, see few sanctioned paths to it. Some have turned to Starfleet, believing that in the far reaches of space, aboard exploratory vessels constantly exposed to unknown threats, they may find the trials that the Empire now seems unable or unwilling to offer. A growing number whisper that true battle lies beyond the Empire’s borders, among the Federation’s enemies, and not within the stagnant confines of the Empire’s peace.Yet these ideas are spoken quietly, cautiously. The thought of joining the Federation, of fighting not for the Empire but for its longtime ally, is still heresy to most. Those Klingons who serve in Starfleet often struggle under the command of non-Klingon officers. Some wash out. Others rise, changed, speaking of a broader galaxy and a greater purpose but not all are believed.There is a deeper danger still. As the thirst for battle festers, and the Federation is seen as unworthy of trust, there is talk of turning blades inward. Some Houses now argue that the Empire must reclaim its old strength by purging weakness from within. If the Empire cannot expand, if its warriors have no wars to fight, then the next great conflict may be a civil one, sparked as much by internal division as by the failure of faith in the Federation.What remains of the alliance now walks a knife’s edge: peace born of necessity, held together by old promises, and strained by growing resentment.By 2390, Cardassia is beginning to stand again with purpose. The last decade has seen the slow recovery of a people who were nearly erased, not just by war, but by the ideologies that once defined them. What remains now is a humbled society, cautious but determined to prove that its survival was not a mistake, and that Cardassian culture is more than military parades and imperial doctrine.The scars of the Dominion War remain deep, but the rawness has begun to fade into something more constructive. The Federation withdrawal in 2379 marked a turning point; Cardassians have spent the last ten years governing themselves once more, under the reformed Detapa Council, a governing body still widely seen as experimental, but increasingly legitimate. Its hybrid structure is part democratically elected and part institutionally appointed. It has led to contentious but healthy political discourse. The council is still small, just nine members, but its decisions have had profound impact.A new generation has grown up with very different heroes: scientists, artists, diplomats. These are the Cardassians now filling their world with bold murals, philosophical manifestos, and public debates once suppressed under the old regime. There is a revival of Cardassian culture, not as propaganda, but as living history. There is an effort to prove, both to themselves and to the galaxy, that they are more than what they were.Relations with Bajor have matured into something that few could have imagined a decade earlier. Cardassians living on Bajor, and Bajorans living on Cardassia Prime form a quiet but significant bridge between the two peoples. A formal Bajoran mission in Lakarian City is now a fixture, and several Cardassian universities offer classes in Bajoran spiritual philosophy, literature, and language.The Detapa Council has honored its promise of reparations through service, rather than wealth. Cardassian engineers and architects have participated in the reconstruction of Bajoran temples and irrigation systems as symbolic gestures. The fact that these efforts have been well received has done more to change Cardassian hearts than any speech ever could.Among Cardassian youth, especially those raised in the post-war era, Federation ideals resonate more clearly than the rigid doctrines of the old Guard. Yet there is a parallel movement, one that seeks a uniquely Cardassian future, independent from the shadows of both Dominion and Federation influence. These Cardassians are not anti-Federation, but they are wary of being shaped by others yet again.If the last decade was about survival and atonement, the coming decade is about reinvention. Cardassia stands at a crossroad asking a difficult question: Who are we, now that we know what we were?And for the first time in living memory, the galaxy is listening.The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.By 2390, Grand Nagus Rom’s reforms have taken firm root in Ferengi society, creating one of the most dramatic cultural shifts in recent galactic history. Gender equality is now codified in Ferengi law, with women not only participating in the workforce but rising to powerful positions across commerce and politics. Rom’s doctrine of “long-term profits” has shifted the prevailing wisdom away from short-term scams toward stable, repeatable business ventures.A new generation of Ferengi have been raised on the Supplemental Rules of Acquisition, which encourage principles like fair dealing, delayed gratification, and brand loyalty. While traditionalists grumble, the majority of the Alliance has embraced this new philosophy. The Ferengi are still Ferengi, but their methods have matured.Instances of piracy and financial subterfuge have not disappeared, but they have declined significantly in both frequency and ambition. Ferengi privateers now operate as true outliers rather than unofficial arms of state ambition. Though small-time swindling persists at the fringes, the Federation has seen no major thefts or high-level schemes from Ferengi actors in years.Despite internal friction, Rom’s reign remains secure. His ability to increase wealth while avoiding war has earned him the grudging respect of even his critics. The Alliance today is more stable, more prosperous, and more respected than at any time in living memory.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#lore"],"headers":[{"heading":"Timeline","level":8,"id":"Timeline_0"},{"heading":"The Romulans","level":8,"id":"The_Romulans_0"},{"heading":"The Klingons","level":8,"id":"The_Klingons_0"},{"heading":"The Cardassians","level":8,"id":"The_Cardassians_0"},{"heading":"The Borg","level":8,"id":"The_Borg_0"},{"heading":"The Dominion","level":8,"id":"The_Dominion_0"},{"heading":"The Breen","level":8,"id":"The_Breen_0"},{"heading":"The Ferengi","level":8,"id":"The_Ferengi_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2390.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["shackleton-expanse/lore/the-year-2390.md"],"createdTime":1747745492923,"modifiedTime":1748104548020,"sourceSize":70,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Lore/The Galaxy in 2390.md","exportPath":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2390.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":13,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"lore/the-shackleton-expanse.html":{"title":"The Shackleton Expanse","icon":"","description":"The Shackleton ExpanseFar from the heart of the Federation lies the Shackleton Expanse, a massive area of space deep within the Beta Quadrant.

Meanwhile the Artifact was stolen from the lab. Admiral Banna Stoker gave instructions to the Sekhmet to find it. The artifact could not be located on the station, and only 2 starships had left Narendra Station recently.The Sekhmet started by chasing down a Klingon Bird of Prey, who turned out to be innocent. This mistake meant an Orion Freighter made it all the way to the Romulan Neutral Zone before the Sekhmet caught up. In the neutral zone, they found the back end of the freighter caved in like an aluminum can, with some kind of gravity field compressing the ship's hull.Lt. Commander Val ordered the freighter to be hulled away with a tractor beam, but in the same moment a Romulan decloaked and caught the freighter in it's own tractor beam. This lead to a brief firefight. The Sekhmet disabled the Orion freighters shields and beamed the artifact aboard. The artifact was still attached to an Orion via a telepathic link which would kill him if removed forcefully.The the Orion freighter captain, Paljara, begged Val to send the artifact back, as it was ransom for her sister's life. Val refused to comply. The Romulan captain also threatened the Sekhmet, warning of dire consequences if the artifact and the Orion were not returned.In the end, the Sekhmet managed to charge it's warp drive and race back to Narendra station.

However, the artifact's signal overloaded the failsafe meant to protect Val. It was deemed unsafe to continue these kinds of investigations.A shuttle was found rushing out of the Shackleton Expanse and towards the Sekhmet. Admiral Stoker was aboard and had taken damage as if in a firefight. When she boarded, she ordered the Sekhmet to head towards the Pasqual system in the Shackleton. Investigation into the shuttle revealed that she had indeed gotten into a fight with an unknown civilization. Her shuttle had visited several systems in the Shackleton.After cleaning up, Stoker briefed the crew on their mission: Pasqual-1 was an M-Class planet with a strange electromagnetic field shielding it from sensors. Stoker expected this planet might have remnants from the same civilization as Bacchus. The crew was also to keep a lookout for enemy ships that may have followed Stoker's shuttleAfter the briefing, Stoker took Conrak and Val aside and made it clear that the civilian Hik was to be enlisted into the Starfleet command structure or be removed from the ship's crew. Hik would be given a suitable position for her experience.The Sekhmet arrived at Pasqual-1 and found it covered in approximately 500 black obsidian monoliths, each about 3 stories tall. Each one had a small settlement build around it from a pre-industrial civilization.The Sekhmet put together an away team for Pasqual-1, and beamed down even through the electromagnetic interference. They aimed several kilometers outside a settlement and intended to work their way in to investigate the monolith there. In the woods, the away team was attacked by 4 panther-like predators, which were then killed or scared away.On the way to the nearest monolith, the away team followed a river until they found a woman and two children by a waterfall.

The electromagnetic field seemed to be an unintended interaction of the monoliths and the planet's crust.Val, Conrak, Sorren, and Karnes approached the three locals of Pasqual-1 at the waterfall. After making introductions, Val was able to mind meld with the locals to communicate. The woman introduced herself as Zumala, and the two children were Tadbon and Klopflim. Val hid their true origins from Zumala during the mind meld, but Zumala was able to sense him holding back information.The away team followed the three Pasqualese into their town, and were introduced to their elder, Jasper. Sorren and Val investigated the monolith in the center of town while Conrak aquainted himself with the locals.During a shared dinner outdoors, the monolith lit up in blue lights and 12 people around it fell to the ground, convulsing as it electrocuted.

They also found that every 6 months or so, the tower would send a signal out to several members of the community to revise their DNA, and then their children would be born with new features.With this information, the away team decided to return to the transport pickup spot.

In these conversation, Stoker attempted to threaten these new civilizations with the power of the Federation unless they revealed any ancient alien artifacts or facilities on their planets.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/bottle-episodes/life-and-soul-(holodeck).html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-6-life-and-soul.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753011850859,"modifiedTime":1754376856710,"sourceSize":2594,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 6 - Life and Soul.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-6-life-and-soul.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":25,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-7-border-dispute.html":{"title":"Sekhmet Log 7 - Border Dispute","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 67333\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Border Dispute\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/border-dispute.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Border Dispute</a>\nNote:: The USS Sekhmet was sent to rendezvous with the Nightingale but arrived to find it crippled by a Romulan Warbird inside the Neutral Zone. The Sekhmet launched a surprise attack and disabled the Warbird’s shields. During the battle, a Starfleet shuttle launched from the Nightingale and fled to the Romulans, forcing the Sekhmet to destroy it before it could escape. The pilot was revealed to be T’Lek, a Vulcan officer now presumed to be a traitor.The USS Sekhmet was sent to rendevous with the USS Nightingale to investigate what Admiral Stoker had done there before going into the Shackleton expanse.The Nightingale was a survey ship that had done a pass into the shackleton expanse along a long patrol. They were currently doing a sweep along the Romulan Neutral Zone.Before the Sekhmet could arrive, the Nightingale unexpectedly veered into the neutral zone. They were attacked by a Romulan Warbird, which disabled the ship and killed half their crew, with another 25% severely injured.However, the Romulans claimed to have taken a hit to their shields and were performing repairs before they would take the Nightingale and its crew as prisoners of war.The Sekhmet arrived and managed to disguise it's arrival in a nebula. From here they observed the scene. The Romulan Warbird was not truly damaged. The Sekhmet's crew assumed the Romulans may be recovering an agent or or asset.The Sekhmet launched a surprise attack against the Warbird, and managed to truly disable it's shields with a torpedo salvo and then move into a position to protect the Nightingale. The Warbird attempted to defend itself and repair it's shields, but it was too late.In the middle of the fight, a shuttle departed from the Nightingale careening towards the Warbird. It moved fast enough that the Sekhmet was unable to capture it in a tractor beam, and retreated into the wings of the Warbird. With no other way to stop the shuttle and fears that critical information could get into Romulan hands, the Sekhmet fired upon the shuttle itself destroying it and killing it's only crew member.The Romulan Warbird hailed the Sekhmet and said its goodbyes. It was none other than Sub-Commander Thal'vaek.With the Romulans taken care of, the Sekhmet performed basic repairs and relief for the survivors on the Nightingale. Their computers had been disabled by their captain using the Romulan Protocal, and a supposed Vulcan Starfleet Lieutenant named T'Lek had been working to restore them to assist with repairs. However, soon after computers were back online, during the fight, the T'Lek took the shuttle to the Romulans. It's currently unknown what intel T'Lek intended to give to Thal'vaek.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/border-dispute.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-7-border-dispute.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753584052737,"modifiedTime":1754376860658,"sourceSize":3173,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 7 - Border Dispute.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-7-border-dispute.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":26,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-8-order-in-court.html":{"title":"Sekhmet Log 8 - Order in Court","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 67353\nSession Summary:: Yeoman Himari prosecuted, and led by accusing the Admiral of going outside Starfleet regulations and ignoring the normal chain of command.

When the Sekhmet arrived, it was violently thrown out of warp by a massive subspace distortion wave. With warp-speed rendered impossible and subspace communications completely washed out by background subspace frequencies in the system, they managed to push a probe far enoguh outside the system to get a distress signal out.Next, an away was sent down to Bacchus-3 to investigate the source of the distortion waves. A small coalition team of Starfleet and Klingon officers seemed entranced by the giant monoliths sticking out of the surface of the planet. Soon, the scientists opened the monoliths, revealing a facility on the inside. Two of the closest scientists threw themselves into the facility, getting vaporized instantly.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 1.2 - Escaping from Bacchus-3.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 1.2 - Escaping from Bacchus-3.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-1.2-escaping-from-bacchus-3.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 1.2 - Escaping from Bacchus-3</a>: Stardate 67156, Session: 2The Sekhmet's away team ventured into the spire on Bacchus-3, and found a message from an unknown alien race. They asked the away team to find \"the facility\". They disabled the subspace distortion wave, and evacuated from the planet and the system, bringing wanted Klingon pirates with them.The Sekhmet's away team managed to retrain the remaining survivors on Bacchus-3 before they ran into the spire's interior. Val mind-melded with the science team's vulcan officer, and found a repeating message in his subconscious: \"Find the facility.\" Sorran Vek found that D'Lok, a Klingon, at a brainwave resonating with the subspace distortion frequency.Conrak phasered one of the two phaser arrays guarding the entrance, which activated a security system closing the door. Conrak rushed forward and held the door open while Val disabled the second one. The away team entered the spire, leaving a small security team to guard the restrained scientists.Inside, the engineering specialist Victoria noted the amounts of power running through the spire was no enormous there were very few practical uses for it all. But it was enough power to punch wormholes through space-time. At the center of the spire, the found a control room with consoles for security, power management, subspace field generation, and more. They disabled the security system first, and then turned off the subspace field generator.An automated hologram projection of an alien introduced themselves as representing the \"Displaced.\" The implored the group to find something called \"The Facility\" but didn't know where it was. It said its people were in peril and asked for the away team to go save them. It directed the away to to collect a bread-box sized sandstone prism with runes carved along the outside.The automated messenger finally urged them to leave quickly, because their ship would be in danger. The spires of Bacchus-3 was tractoring the nearest planet towards it, ripping the planet apart as it went. It was rebuilding a new Spire to replace the disabled one. A meteor shower threatened to destroy the Sekhmet and a disabled Klingon vessel. The away team and others on the surface returned to the SekhmetThe Klingon vessel had arrived to find their \"compatriots\", and demanded to have them returned. Val convinced the Klingons that if they allowed the Sekhmet to tractor them out of the system to safety, then the fugitives would be returned, with an implication that they would be set free.However, the commanding officer Vrenta Ewasi instead ordered the Sekhmet to rendezvous with Starfleet vessels answering a distress signal. The Klingons were arrest, and the Sekhmet praised for not only saving the survey team, but also bringing in wanted criminals.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 2 - Peas to Meet You.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 2 - Peas to Meet You.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-2-peas-to-meet-you.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 2 - Peas to Meet You</a>: Stardate 67197, Session: 3The Sekhmet assisted the USS Constantine in delivering a crucial agricultural exchange to a colony in the Bix system. The crew and passengers of the Constantine had succumbed to a neurotoxin produced by Ice Peas while not in it's natural habitat.The USS Sekhmet was sent to investigate the USS Constantine, a Galaxy Class starship itself tasked with transporting an agricultural exchange from the Colony on Re-Alpha to a struggling colony on Bix. Aboard the Sekhmet, a boarding party found the crew of the Constantine acting strangely. The Executive officer ambushed the party, seemingly paranoid that they were intruders. The Captain was engaged in some sort of wrestling tournament, and various other crew members were exhibiting strong emotional reactions.The boarding party found the crew was under the effects of a neurotoxin called Wexylin-5C, which would cause different reactions from each person as a stress response. They tracked down the source of this neurotoxin to a plan on board called Ice Peas. The colonists had brought the crop on board and were sharing the food with the crew. The crop had been removed from it's natural habitat and was creating this neurotoxin in response to losing a particular fungus in it's soil. The boarding party was able to reintroduce the fungus into the Ice Pea bushes soil substitute, and bring the crew back to normal.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 3 - Orion Heist.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 3 - Orion Heist.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-3-orion-heist.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 3 - Orion Heist</a>: Stardate 67217, Session: 4The Sekhmet was sent to pursue an Orion freighter which had stolen the Bacchus Artifact. The chase lead to the Romulan neutral zone. Before the Sekhmet could tractor beam the freighter and head back to base, a Romulan Warbird decloaked. The Sekhmet disabled the freighter's shields, beamed the artifact aboard, and fled the neutral zone before the Warbird could break the Sekhmet's own shields.While Lt Sorran was studying the Bacchus artifact, Lt Kassandra Pruitt, suffered a massive neural failure cascade, sending her to the emergency room. Meanwhile the Artifact was stolen from the lab. Admiral Banna Stoker gave instructions to the Sekhmet to find it. The artifact could not be located on the station, and only 2 starships had left Narendra Station recently.The Sekhmet started by chasing down a Klingon Bird of Prey, who turned out to be innocent. This mistake meant an Orion Freighter made it all the way to the Romulan Neutral Zone before the Sekhmet caught up. In the neutral zone, they found the back end of the freighter caved in like an aluminum can, with some kind of gravity field compressing the ship's hull.Lt. Commander Val ordered the freighter to be hulled away with a tractor beam, but in the same moment a Romulan decloaked and caught the freighter in it's own tractor beam. This lead to a brief firefight. The Sekhmet disabled the Orion freighters shields and beamed the artifact aboard. The artifact was still attached to an Orion via a telepathic link which would kill him if removed forcefully.The the Orion freighter captain, Paljara, begged Val to send the artifact back, as it was ransom for her sister's life. Val refused to comply. The Romulan captain also threatened the Sekhmet, warning of dire consequences if the artifact and the Orion were not returned.In the end, the Sekhmet managed to charge it's warp drive and race back to Narendra station. Admiral Stoker commended the Sekhmet for a job well done. But as the Sekhmet retreated, the Romulans had destroyed the Orion freighter.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 4 - Imminent Collision.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 4 - Imminent Collision.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-4-imminent-collision.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 4 - Imminent Collision</a>: Stardate 67233, Session: 5The Sekhmet made first contact with a new species made of crystal that communicated with refracted light. They crew assisted the aliens by removing an unidentified torpedo from the hull, and sent them on their way.After Narendra Station picked up an unidentified object approaching the station at high warp speeds, the USS Sekhmet was sent to investigate while the station prepared for a potential attack. They found a strange crystalline starship and attempted rudimentary and cooperative communication with it. On board the crystal starship, the crew found an unidentified torpedo lodged into the side of the structure, seemingly made just for the purpose of attacking this kind of starship. As the hull of the ship seemed to be a living entity of some sort, an away team organized a surgical bomb disposal procedure to remove the torpedo safely. This triggered the torpedo to explode and it was sent into space with an emergency transport.Once the torpedo was removed, the strange crystal beings who communicated through light refraction departed back into the Shackleton Expanse.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem</a>: Stardate 67255, Session: 6The Sekhmet picked up Admiral Stoker and was ordered to Pasqual-1. There, they found a planet cloaked in an electromagnetic field that interfered with sensors and would disable and electronic equipment. It was covered in hundreds of strange black obelisks, 3 stories tall, and was home to a pre-industrial civilization.Sorran and Val were continuing investigation into Bacchus Artifact by performing controlled mind melds into it. However, the artifact's signal overloaded the failsafe meant to protect Val. It was deemed unsafe to continue these kinds of investigations.A shuttle was found rushing out of the Shackleton Expanse and towards the Sekhmet. Admiral Stoker was aboard and had taken damage as if in a firefight. When she boarded, she ordered the Sekhmet to head towards the Pasqual system in the Shackleton. Investigation into the shuttle revealed that she had indeed gotten into a fight with an unknown civilization. Her shuttle had visited several systems in the Shackleton.After cleaning up, Stoker briefed the crew on their mission: Pasqual-1 was an M-Class planet with a strange electromagnetic field shielding it from sensors. Stoker expected this planet might have remnants from the same civilization as Bacchus. The crew was also to keep a lookout for enemy ships that may have followed Stoker's shuttleAfter the briefing, Stoker took Conrak and Val aside and made it clear that the civilian Hik was to be enlisted into the Starfleet command structure or be removed from the ship's crew. Hik would be given a suitable position for her experience.The Sekhmet arrived at Pasqual-1 and found it covered in approximately 500 black obsidian monoliths, each about 3 stories tall. Each one had a small settlement build around it from a pre-industrial civilization.The Sekhmet put together an away team for Pasqual-1, and beamed down even through the electromagnetic interference. They aimed several kilometers outside a settlement and intended to work their way in to investigate the monolith there. In the woods, the away team was attacked by 4 panther-like predators, which were then killed or scared away.On the way to the nearest monolith, the away team followed a river until they found a woman and two children by a waterfall. They were doing laundry. Each one looked to be a different species than the others altogether.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.2 - Monoliths.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.2 - Monoliths.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-5.2-monoliths.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 5.2 - Monoliths</a>: Stardate 67255, Session: 7Val, Conrak, Sorren, and Karnes explored Pasqual-1 and followed some locals back to a community built around a black monolith. They discovered that the monolith was performing genetic experiments and forcefully evolving the population, and then attempting to send it to the Seku system. The electromagnetic field seemed to be an unintended interaction of the monoliths and the planet's crust.Val, Conrak, Sorren, and Karnes approached the three locals of Pasqual-1 at the waterfall. After making introductions, Val was able to mind meld with the locals to communicate. The woman introduced herself as Zumala, and the two children were Tadbon and Klopflim. Val hid their true origins from Zumala during the mind meld, but Zumala was able to sense him holding back information.The away team followed the three Pasqualese into their town, and were introduced to their elder, Jasper. Sorren and Val investigated the monolith in the center of town while Conrak aquainted himself with the locals.During a shared dinner outdoors, the monolith lit up in blue lights and 12 people around it fell to the ground, convulsing as it electrocuted. The people of the village seemed worried about it, but expected it to happen.Val convinced Jasper to bring them underneath the monolith, which Jasper considered holy ground. But in the mind meld, Jasper gleaned that the away team with from the stars and interpreted that as the team being angels. He asked them to bring him with them to the stars and Val agreed (at least temporarily.)Underneath the monolith, the away team found a control room. After some investigation, they discovered the control room was attempting to send genetic information from the community out to the Seku system in the Shackleton Expanse. They also found that every 6 months or so, the tower would send a signal out to several members of the community to revise their DNA, and then their children would be born with new features.With this information, the away team decided to return to the transport pickup spot. They brought Jasper, but Jasper was left behind as they were beamed back onto the Sekhmet. The Sekhmet was in red alert, and under attack.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.3 - Vinshari Attack.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.3 - Vinshari Attack.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-5.3-vinshari-attack.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 5.3 - Vinshari Attack</a>: Stardate 67255, Session: 8When the away team on Pasqual-1 returned to the Sekhmet, it was under attack from a starship crewed by the Vinshari, a new civilization. Conrak and Val were able to work efficiently as a team and quickly disabled the starship. The Vinshari claimed that the Admiral had stolen from them, and demanded the Admiral be handed over to them to face justice. In the end, Admiral Stoker was arrested for attempting to destroy the Vinshari starship while it was defenseless.The away team on Pasqual-1 returned to the USS Sekhmet to find it under attack. Conrak and Val rushed to battle stations on the bridge where Admiral Stoker and Captain Vrenta were keeping things under control so far.The enemy ship was a strange slender design with masts holding up sails. It fired weapons with physical projectiles with surprising effectiveness. Conrak and Val coordinated to return fire quick, dealing some damage to its shields. The Enemy fired a harpoon, which pierced a hole in the shielding and began draining energy from the Sekhmet's hull. Bov organized an emergy response team to dislodge the harpoon.The enemy ship retreated behind the planet and came swinging around the other side, but Conrak and Val were ready for them. Bov diverted Reserve power to the weapons and Conrak disabled their shield. Then Val ordered a torpedo to be fired. Admiral Stoker doubled down on the order and asked for a full salvo of torpedoes, enough to completely obliterate the enemy ship. Conrak did fire a Salvo but intentionally missed with several of the torpedoes.Captain Vrenta stood up against the admiral, saying that firing on a defenseless ship was ground to arrest the Admiral, and that's exactly what happened. Further, the bridge crew from the enemy vessel was beamed onto the Sekhmet and arrested for interrogation. They had blood red skin and high collar bones. They called themselves the Vinshari.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 6 - Life and Soul.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 6 - Life and Soul.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-6-life-and-soul.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 6 - Life and Soul</a>: Stardate 67314, Session: 9The crew investigated a strange holodeck program found on Admiral Stoker’s shuttle.

They found them disguised as the blueprints for atomic weapons in the private mansion of German weapons dealer.As Star Fleet prepared for Admiral Stoker’s trial, Bov and Val were picking apart her shuttle, looking for hidden evidence. They found a holodeck program, created on the shuttle itself during her solo excursion into the Shackleton Expanse.The program was a pulpy 1950's themed spy mission, where the party was tasked with recovering atomic bomb blueprints from a German weapons dealer named Mr. Halgrave.Halgrave was hosting a birthday party, where multiple other people were trying to acquire the plans. Most of the other guests were invited by Halgrave for his supposed birthday party. But Allied intelligence suspected the party was cover for an auction.At the party, Halgrave was no where to be seen. But the crew met with several would-be buyers at the auction. Val spoke with some of the guests along with Bov and Relek Tovan, trying to guess what Stoker's intention was. Meanwhile, Conrak infiltrated the upper floor and found a stockpile of machine guns. Security guards arrived and Conrak took them all out.In the ballroom, Val through a explosive pen at Halgrave, injuring him. Conrak was able to finish Hagrave off and took a key off the body. The key opened Halgrave's office, which had the atomic weapons blueprints on themBut the blueprints were not blueprints at all. Instead, there was a large conspiracy board full of logs, maps, and other data pertaining to Stoker’s solo adventure into the Shackleton Expanse, including a star map of suspected “Facility” locations and first-contact conversations with people calling themselves Akaru and Vinshari. In these conversation, Stoker attempted to threaten these new civilizations with the power of the Federation unless they revealed any ancient alien artifacts or facilities on their planets.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 7 - Border Dispute.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 7 - Border Dispute.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-7-border-dispute.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 7 - Border Dispute</a>: Stardate 67333, Session: 10The USS Sekhmet was sent to rendezvous with the Nightingale but arrived to find it crippled by a Romulan Warbird inside the Neutral Zone. The Sekhmet launched a surprise attack and disabled the Warbird’s shields. During the battle, a Starfleet shuttle launched from the Nightingale and fled to the Romulans, forcing the Sekhmet to destroy it before it could escape. The pilot was revealed to be T’Lek, a Vulcan officer now presumed to be a traitor.The USS Sekhmet was sent to rendevous with the USS Nightingale to investigate what Admiral Stoker had done there before going into the Shackleton expanse.The Nightingale was a survey ship that had done a pass into the shackleton expanse along a long patrol. They were currently doing a sweep along the Romulan Neutral Zone.Before the Sekhmet could arrive, the Nightingale unexpectedly veered into the neutral zone. They were attacked by a Romulan Warbird, which disabled the ship and killed half their crew, with another 25% severely injured.However, the Romulans claimed to have taken a hit to their shields and were performing repairs before they would take the Nightingale and its crew as prisoners of war.The Sekhmet arrived and managed to disguise it's arrival in a nebula. From here they observed the scene. The Romulan Warbird was not truly damaged. The Sekhmet's crew assumed the Romulans may be recovering an agent or or asset.The Sekhmet launched a surprise attack against the Warbird, and managed to truly disable it's shields with a torpedo salvo and then move into a position to protect the Nightingale. The Warbird attempted to defend itself and repair it's shields, but it was too late.In the middle of the fight, a shuttle departed from the Nightingale careening towards the Warbird. It moved fast enough that the Sekhmet was unable to capture it in a tractor beam, and retreated into the wings of the Warbird. With no other way to stop the shuttle and fears that critical information could get into Romulan hands, the Sekhmet fired upon the shuttle itself destroying it and killing it's only crew member.The Romulan Warbird hailed the Sekhmet and said its goodbyes. It was none other than Sub-Commander Thal'vaek.With the Romulans taken care of, the Sekhmet performed basic repairs and relief for the survivors on the Nightingale. Their computers had been disabled by their captain using the Romulan Protocal, and a supposed Vulcan Starfleet Lieutenant named T'Lek had been working to restore them to assist with repairs. However, soon after computers were back online, during the fight, the T'Lek took the shuttle to the Romulans. It's currently unknown what intel T'Lek intended to give to Thal'vaek.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 8 - Order in Court.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 8 - Order in Court.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-8-order-in-court.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 8 - Order in Court</a>: Stardate 67353, Session: 11- Season 2\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 9.1 - -Abyss Station.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 9.1 - -Abyss Station.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-9.1-abyss-station.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 9.1 - -Abyss Station</a>: Stardate 67369, Session: 12The USS Sekhmet investigated the Omega Draconis system, discovering a neutronium station, a barren planet inhabited by the Ithik, and a rotating black hole with radiation jets threatening systems within 100 light years. One away team went to the planet and met the Ithik people who were waiting for the black hole to destroy their planet and ascend to a higher form of existence. On the station, another away team visited the station's engineering section and deactivated power to security systems. They then went up to the control room, which was held by a team of Vinshari.The USS Sekhmet arrived in the Omega Draconis system after Admiral Stoker's hint to look into it. The black hole's radiation jets were rotating to align with the galactic plane, threatening any number of systems within 100 light years. Long range scans estimate that the rotation started just a few weeks ago.In the system, they found the neutronium space station, the black hole, and a single barren planet with 300 life signs on it. They also found a Vinshari ship with a skeleton crew in the system, and chased it away. One away team went to the only planet in the system, and another went to the neutronium station, suspecting that the station may be controlling the wormhole.On the planet, the away team met a species called the Ithik, who seemed to worship the black hole, awaiting the day that it would \"turn it's gaze towards them. They were interpreting the rotation of the radiation jets of their final rapture. They away team was shown the Ithik meditation chambers, The Sekhmet team discovered signs of extreme danger and turned their focus to the station orbiting nearby.The station's away team headed first to engineering, where they found a suite of singularity engines powering the station’s systems. Most of the output was being funneled into controlling the black hole itself, but subsystems also supported wormhole generation, advanced security, and a vast cloning facility. To prioritize recovery efforts, the crew diverted energy away from security and into the cloning bays, activating approximately 300 stasis pods on the station.The team then moved to the control room, where they found Vinshari operatives already inside, presumably attempting to seize the station’s technology. This set the stage for a confrontation over control of the station and its powerful systems, while the greater danger of the black hole’s shifting radiation remained unresolved.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 9.2 - Chaktir.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 9.2 - Chaktir.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-9.2-chaktir.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 9.2 - Chaktir</a>: Stardate 67369, Session: 13The Sekhmet’s away team captured the station control room after defeating a Vinshari squad and discovered that its cloning facilities had been producing successive generations of the people on the planet. On Chaktir, the crew struggled to persuade the Ithik ministers to evacuate, successfully swaying Temeran and Genji by reframing the black hole’s radiation surge as divine punishment rather than ascension. Meanwhile, Commander Val underwent a dangerous Ithik nanoprobe infusion.The USS Sekhmet continued its mission in the Omega Draconis system, focusing on both the neutronium station and the Ithik colony on Chaktir. On the station, the away team staged an ambush around the control room, surrounding the Vinshari from multiple angles and catching them by surprise. Lt. Conrac led the charge, using his Numgo Teeka bostaff-like weapon to knock out most of the Vinshari singlehandedly. Their leader, a woman wielding holo-emitter batons, created illusions and false walls before trapping herself in a force field once her team was defeated.With the control room secured, the team analyzed the station’s systems further and confirmed that its technology was producing successive generations of the Ithik people living on Chaktir. Meanwhile, on the planet, the away team worked to convince the Ithik to evacuate ahead of the black hole’s shifting radiation jets. Through Minister Temeran, they framed the event as a divine punishment rather than an ascension, sowing doubt in the religious prophecy. While Temeran and Gengi began to waver, the Minister of Astronomy remained unconvinced.Elsewhere, Commander Val experienced a strange compulsion to seek out \"The Facility\", eventually visiting Minister Vodlin, the Minister of Wellbeing. They offered an infusion of Ithik nanoprobes, so Val submerged in a tank of nanite-rich gel, resisting multiple attempts by the swarm to seize control of his body and mind. Val emerged transformed but stable. The away team prepared for a final confrontation with Mayor Akkara, with only limited time remaining to convince him to evacuate his people before the black hole’s radiation surge reached the planet.
