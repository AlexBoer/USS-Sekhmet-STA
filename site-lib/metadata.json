Galaxy in 2390","icon":"","description":"The Year 2390TLDR Klingons Admiration of Starfleet as capable warriors and honorable allies has begun to dwindle. While the 2380s have been a time of unprecedented peace and cooperation, it left Klingons restless and with no one to fight. In 2390, several missteps have signaled to the Klingons that there is weakness and dishonor in Starfleet.\nRomulans Throughout the 2380s, the Romulans were left terrified of the Federation, thinking that Starfleet could be capable of anything. But that changed after the Hobus supernova. Now, the Romulans are splintered into factions, many of whom blame the Federation for what happened.\nCardassians have almost recovered from the Dominion attack and are now working on an tentative alliance with the Federation. Bajorans are leading the way to this cooperation and the situation is not unlike the early days of peace between the Federation and Klingon Empire.\nFerengis have undergone a massive cultural shift: lying and scamming is seen as unprofitable and there is a massive effort still to repair their damaged reputation in the Galaxy. Still, some small factions wish to return to the old ways and are seeking new fools to scam on new frontiers.\nBorg are quiet, but everyone is still on edge about them.\nThe Dominion is closely guarded against, but individuals are allowed in after checking in at DS9.\nThe Federation is at the height of its power and most opponents have been allied with or defeated. The return of Voyager inspired a new age of exploration and Narendra Station was founded. But since then, cracks have started to form in the Federation's pristine reputation and internal strife has become apparent. The adventure starts in the year 2390, 4 years after the Hobus supernova that destroyed the Romulus home world and to Earth, and 16 years after the conclusion of the Dominion War. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.By 2390, the Romulans regard the Federation with a colder, more calculating eye. Their traditional arrogance has cooled, but not out of newfound respect .They have come to see the Federation not as naïve idealists, but as something far more dangerous: idealists who are willing to betray their own ideals when pushed hard enough.The revelations about Section 31’s role in ending the Dominion War, previously dismissed as Federation disinformation, are now widely accepted among Romulan intelligence circles. The logic is chilling to them, but also strangely familiar. A Starfleet captain orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan senator, and the Tal Shiar missed it. Starfleet mined the Bajoran wormhole without preamble, forced the hand of the Dominion, and executed a campaign that devastated enemy supply lines with brutal efficiency. Even the unthinkable happened: the Federation forged a war coalition not only with the Klingon Empire but eventually with Romulus itself, all under the command of Starfleet officers. To Romulan strategists, this was not weakness. It was adaptability cloaked in virtue, and it was alarming.The Hobus supernova only deepened the wound. Though Ambassador Spock’s efforts were noble, and though the Federation initially promised to lead a vast evacuation effort, what followed was a betrayal of staggering proportions. In Romulan eyes, the Federation left them to die stranded in the ruins of their empire, abandoned by the very ally who claimed moral superiority.Worse still, the synth attacks on Mars revealed internal Federation instability. The mighty utopia was not immune to sabotage, nor was it able to safeguard its own infrastructure in the hour of need. When the Federation retracted from the evacuation, citing logistical failures and internal threats, the message to Romulus was clear: when tested, the Federation breaks.What remains of the Romulan government now engages with the Federation not out of trust, but out of necessity. The official relationship continues with joint research projects, including one involving a Borg Cube. But these are cautious engagements, constantly monitored by rival factions within the disintegrated Romulan state. The Senate is weak. The old command structure fractured. Regional power bases, led by admirals, governors, or Tal Shiar remnants, now vie for control in a slow-burning conflict that historians are beginning to call the Second Sundering. It is a quiet Warring States period, fought more in cloak and sabotage than open batte, for now.The Neutral Zone still exists, in name and in function. The Treaty of Algeron remains technically intact. But trade is limited, and trust is scarce. For the time being, the Romulans focus inward: rebuilding power, reassessing their place in a galaxy where former allies may yet prove more dangerous than old enemies.Relations between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets are growing tense once again. While the alliance forged in the fires of the Dominion War remains intact, recent events have shaken the perception of the Federation within the High Council and across many of the Great Houses. The synth attacks on Mars (and the Federation’s subsequent abandonment of the Romulan evacuation) have cast a long shadow. To many Klingons, it was not only a strategic failure but a moral collapse: a betrayal born of cowardice and bureaucracy.The Federation, once respected for its resolve in battle and unwavering commitment to its ideals, now appears to some as weak, dishonorable, and lost. Where once Klingon warriors admired the discipline and tenacity of Starfleet, there is now open skepticism. If the Federation would turn its back on its allies, what honor is there in such a partnership?Even so, the political and economic bonds between the two powers run deep. The Klingon Empire is now heavily reliant on Federation dilithium imports to maintain its fleet and economy. War with the Federation would be disastrous, not just on the battlefield, but in the homeworlds, in the markets, and in the halls of power. For all their grievances, most Klingon leaders recognize that open conflict would tear the Empire apart as much as it would harm the Federation.This has created a dangerous contradiction in Klingon society. The blood runs hot. Young warriors, eager for combat and glory, see few sanctioned paths to it. Some have turned to Starfleet, believing that in the far reaches of space, aboard exploratory vessels constantly exposed to unknown threats, they may find the trials that the Empire now seems unable or unwilling to offer. A growing number whisper that true battle lies beyond the Empire’s borders, among the Federation’s enemies, and not within the stagnant confines of the Empire’s peace.Yet these ideas are spoken quietly, cautiously. The thought of joining the Federation, of fighting not for the Empire but for its longtime ally, is still heresy to most. Those Klingons who serve in Starfleet often struggle under the command of non-Klingon officers. Some wash out. Others rise, changed, speaking of a broader galaxy and a greater purpose but not all are believed.There is a deeper danger still. As the thirst for battle festers, and the Federation is seen as unworthy of trust, there is talk of turning blades inward. Some Houses now argue that the Empire must reclaim its old strength by purging weakness from within. If the Empire cannot expand, if its warriors have no wars to fight, then the next great conflict may be a civil one, sparked as much by internal division as by the failure of faith in the Federation.What remains of the alliance now walks a knife’s edge: peace born of necessity, held together by old promises, and strained by growing resentment.By 2390, Cardassia is beginning to stand again with purpose. The last decade has seen the slow recovery of a people who were nearly erased, not just by war, but by the ideologies that once defined them. What remains now is a humbled society, cautious but determined to prove that its survival was not a mistake, and that Cardassian culture is more than military parades and imperial doctrine.The scars of the Dominion War remain deep, but the rawness has begun to fade into something more constructive. The Federation withdrawal in 2379 marked a turning point; Cardassians have spent the last ten years governing themselves once more, under the reformed Detapa Council, a governing body still widely seen as experimental, but increasingly legitimate. Its hybrid structure is part democratically elected and part institutionally appointed. It has led to contentious but healthy political discourse. The council is still small, just nine members, but its decisions have had profound impact.A new generation has grown up with very different heroes: scientists, artists, diplomats. These are the Cardassians now filling their world with bold murals, philosophical manifestos, and public debates once suppressed under the old regime. There is a revival of Cardassian culture, not as propaganda, but as living history. There is an effort to prove, both to themselves and to the galaxy, that they are more than what they were.Relations with Bajor have matured into something that few could have imagined a decade earlier. Cardassians living on Bajor, and Bajorans living on Cardassia Prime form a quiet but significant bridge between the two peoples. A formal Bajoran mission in Lakarian City is now a fixture, and several Cardassian universities offer classes in Bajoran spiritual philosophy, literature, and language.The Detapa Council has honored its promise of reparations through service, rather than wealth. Cardassian engineers and architects have participated in the reconstruction of Bajoran temples and irrigation systems as symbolic gestures. The fact that these efforts have been well received has done more to change Cardassian hearts than any speech ever could.Among Cardassian youth, especially those raised in the post-war era, Federation ideals resonate more clearly than the rigid doctrines of the old Guard. Yet there is a parallel movement, one that seeks a uniquely Cardassian future, independent from the shadows of both Dominion and Federation influence. These Cardassians are not anti-Federation, but they are wary of being shaped by others yet again.If the last decade was about survival and atonement, the coming decade is about reinvention. Cardassia stands at a crossroad asking a difficult question: Who are we, now that we know what we were?And for the first time in living memory, the galaxy is listening.The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.By 2390, Grand Nagus Rom’s reforms have taken firm root in Ferengi society, creating one of the most dramatic cultural shifts in recent galactic history. Gender equality is now codified in Ferengi law, with women not only participating in the workforce but rising to powerful positions across commerce and politics. Rom’s doctrine of “long-term profits” has shifted the prevailing wisdom away from short-term scams toward stable, repeatable business ventures.A new generation of Ferengi have been raised on the Supplemental Rules of Acquisition, which encourage principles like fair dealing, delayed gratification, and brand loyalty. While traditionalists grumble, the majority of the Alliance has embraced this new philosophy. The Ferengi are still Ferengi, but their methods have matured.Instances of piracy and financial subterfuge have not disappeared, but they have declined significantly in both frequency and ambition. Ferengi privateers now operate as true outliers rather than unofficial arms of state ambition. Though small-time swindling persists at the fringes, the Federation has seen no major thefts or high-level schemes from Ferengi actors in years.Despite internal friction, Rom’s reign remains secure. His ability to increase wealth while avoiding war has earned him the grudging respect of even his critics. The Alliance today is more stable, more prosperous, and more respected than at any time in living memory.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#lore"],"headers":[{"heading":"Timeline","level":8,"id":"Timeline_0"},{"heading":"The Romulans","level":8,"id":"The_Romulans_0"},{"heading":"The Klingons","level":8,"id":"The_Klingons_0"},{"heading":"The Cardassians","level":8,"id":"The_Cardassians_0"},{"heading":"The Borg","level":8,"id":"The_Borg_0"},{"heading":"The Dominion","level":8,"id":"The_Dominion_0"},{"heading":"The Breen","level":8,"id":"The_Breen_0"},{"heading":"The Ferengi","level":8,"id":"The_Ferengi_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2390.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["shackleton-expanse/lore/the-year-2390.md"],"createdTime":1757603435078,"modifiedTime":1748104548020,"sourceSize":70,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Lore/The Galaxy in 2390.md","exportPath":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2390.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":19,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-1.1-bacchus'-irresistible-call.html":{"title":"Sekhmet Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call","icon":"","description":"Table5 resultsSort0Filter0PropertiesNewCharactersTypePlayer CharacterTypeSupporting CharacterThe USS Sekhmet was sent to investigate the disappearance of a Starfleet science shuttle at the Bacchus system.

Conrak rushed forward and held the door open while Val disabled the second one. The away team entered the spire, leaving a small security team to guard the restrained scientists.Inside, the engineering specialist Victoria noted the amounts of power running through the spire was no enormous there were very few practical uses for it all. But it was enough power to punch wormholes through space-time. At the center of the spire, the found a control room with consoles for security, power management, subspace field generation, and more.

The team hoped to use the creature to help track the warp signature of the fleeing Vistani freighter.Meanwhile, Val initiated an interrogation of the Vistani prisoner to learn more about the slugs, the stolen freighter, and where the fleeing ship might have gone.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Characters","level":2,"id":"Characters_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-10.2-ha'kiv.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1758973665161,"modifiedTime":1761229337758,"sourceSize":2074,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 10.2 - Ha'kiv.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-10.2-ha'kiv.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":39,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"uss-sekhmet.html":{"title":"USS Sekhmet","icon":"","description":"Summary\nLocation:: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Lore/The Shackleton Expanse\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Lore/The Shackleton Expanse\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Shackleton Expanse</a><br>\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20250524-Sekhmet Banner}.webp\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/sekhmet/shared/uss-sekhmet/img-20250524-sekhmet-banner}.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nNote:: Pulled back into service to supplement Starfleet's overextended fleet, the USS Sekhmet stands on guard over Narendra station and the Shackleton Expanse beyond.\nThe USS Sekmet is a Columbia Class cruiser stationed at Narendra Station.

Soren and Tawny tracked the Ha’kiv residue the raiders shed during their escape and picked up a repeating subspace distress signal. The trail led to the Amaddon system, where the crew observed two Ha’kiv—massive space slugs—feeding in a gas giant’s upper atmosphere. Moments later, two large Vinshari ships arrived, harpooned a Ha’kiv like whalers, and hailed the Sekhmet demanding its warp core, claiming “energy is our right.”The Sekhmet refused, ducked behind a planet, and tuned defenses: hull polarization and shield recalibration to blunt Vinshari fire. Tactical then isolated two frequency gaps in the Vinshari shields, setting up clean opening shots. Engagement was imminent, with one objective clear: protect the Ha’kiv and recover the stolen freighter’s trail without losing the ship.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Characters","level":2,"id":"Characters_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-11.1-ambush.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1760849890200,"modifiedTime":1761229331731,"sourceSize":1986,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 11.1 - Ambush.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-11.1-ambush.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":40,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-11.2-boarded.html":{"title":"Sekhmet Log 11.2 - Boarded","icon":"","description":"Table6 resultsSort0Filter0PropertiesNewCharactersTypeNon-Player CharacterTypePlayer CharacterTypeSupporting CharacterThe Vinshari moved to strike, so the Sekhmet swung around a gas giant and opened with phaser arrays.
