Until now, Starfleet preferred to focus on higher-priority regions closer to home. With the end of the war and several years to recover behind the Federation, exploration has become a renewed priority.We have no reliable intelligence reports to suggest that either the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Star Empire have bothered to send reconnaissance ships or probes into the Expanse.

Conrak rushed forward and held the door open while Val disabled the second one. The away team entered the spire, leaving a small security team to guard the restrained scientists.Inside, the engineering specialist Victoria noted the amounts of power running through the spire was no enormous there were very few practical uses for it all. But it was enough power to punch wormholes through space-time. At the center of the spire, the found a control room with consoles for security, power management, subspace field generation, and more.

The spires of Bacchus-3 was tractoring the nearest planet towards it, ripping the planet apart as it went. It was rebuilding a new Spire to replace the disabled one. A meteor shower threatened to destroy the Sekhmet and a disabled Klingon vessel.

Val convinced the Klingons that if they allowed the Sekhmet to tractor them out of the system to safety, then the fugitives would be returned, with an implication that they would be set free.However, the commanding officer Vrenta Ewasi instead ordered the Sekhmet to rendezvous with Starfleet vessels answering a distress signal.

After the bombings on the Mars Utopia Planitia shipyards, Starfleet supplemented it's fleet by pulling retired vessels back into service with substantial refits.The Sekhmet carries a crew of a little over 100 crewman and officers.\nFederation Starship\nColumbia Class\nGarbage Scow\nSekhmet is the Egyptian goddess of war and medicine. The USS Sekhmet is the first of it's name, and was chosen to signal it's equal potential as a protector and threat.The USS Sekhmet, has been assigned to Narendra station as an emergency response and tactical strike starship. While Sekhmet has a regular crew, the Narendra Station provides a rotating roster of commanding officers due to stretched personnel resources and the Sekhmet's irregular mission schedule.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-1.1-bacchus'-irresistible-call.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call</a>: Stardate 67156, Session: 1The Sekhmet investgated a missing science team at Bacchus-3, only to get caught in the same subspace distortion wave and became stranded. On the planet, they found the team strange entranced by massive monoliths, even willing to die to get inside.The USS Sekhmet was sent to investigate the disappearance of a Starfleet science shuttle at the Bacchus system. When the Sekhmet arrived, it was violently thrown out of warp by a massive subspace distortion wave. With warp-speed rendered impossible and subspace communications completely washed out by background subspace frequencies in the system, they managed to push a probe far enoguh outside the system to get a distress signal out.Next, an away was sent down to Bacchus-3 to investigate the source of the distortion waves. A small coalition team of Starfleet and Klingon officers seemed entranced by the giant monoliths sticking out of the surface of the planet. Soon, the scientists opened the monoliths, revealing a facility on the inside. Two of the closest scientists threw themselves into the facility, getting vaporized instantly.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 1.2 - Escaping from Bacchus-3.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 1.2 - Escaping from Bacchus-3.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-1.2-escaping-from-bacchus-3.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 1.2 - Escaping from Bacchus-3</a>: Stardate 67156, Session: 2The Sekhmet's away team ventured into the spire on Bacchus-3, and found a message from an unknown alien race. They asked the away team to find \"the facility\". They disabled the subspace distortion wave, and evacuated from the planet and the system, bringing wanted Klingon pirates with them.The Sekhmet's away team managed to retrain the remaining survivors on Bacchus-3 before they ran into the spire's interior. Val mind-melded with the science team's vulcan officer, and found a repeating message in his subconscious: \"Find the facility.\" Sorran Vek found that D'Lok, a Klingon, at a brainwave resonating with the subspace distortion frequency.Conrak phasered one of the two phaser arrays guarding the entrance, which activated a security system closing the door. Conrak rushed forward and held the door open while Val disabled the second one. The away team entered the spire, leaving a small security team to guard the restrained scientists.Inside, the engineering specialist Victoria noted the amounts of power running through the spire was no enormous there were very few practical uses for it all. But it was enough power to punch wormholes through space-time. At the center of the spire, the found a control room with consoles for security, power management, subspace field generation, and more. They disabled the security system first, and then turned off the subspace field generator.An automated hologram projection of an alien introduced themselves as representing the \"Displaced.\" The implored the group to find something called \"The Facility\" but didn't know where it was. It said its people were in peril and asked for the away team to go save them. It directed the away to to collect a bread-box sized sandstone prism with runes carved along the outside.The automated messenger finally urged them to leave quickly, because their ship would be in danger. The spires of Bacchus-3 was tractoring the nearest planet towards it, ripping the planet apart as it went. It was rebuilding a new Spire to replace the disabled one. A meteor shower threatened to destroy the Sekhmet and a disabled Klingon vessel. The away team and others on the surface returned to the SekhmetThe Klingon vessel had arrived to find their \"compatriots\", and demanded to have them returned. Val convinced the Klingons that if they allowed the Sekhmet to tractor them out of the system to safety, then the fugitives would be returned, with an implication that they would be set free.However, the commanding officer Vrenta Ewasi instead ordered the Sekhmet to rendezvous with Starfleet vessels answering a distress signal. The Klingons were arrest, and the Sekhmet praised for not only saving the survey team, but also bringing in wanted criminals.\n","aliases":["Sekhmet"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Location/Ship"],"headers":[{"heading":"Description","level":1,"id":"Description_0"},{"heading":"Traits","level":2,"id":"Traits_0"},{"heading":"Namesake","level":2,"id":"Namesake_0"},{"heading":"Mission","level":2,"id":"Mission_0"},{"heading":"Mission
