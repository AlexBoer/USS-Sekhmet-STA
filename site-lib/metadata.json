Until now, Starfleet preferred to focus on higher-priority regions closer to home.

Conrak rushed forward and held the door open while Val disabled the second one. The away team entered the spire, leaving a small security team to guard the restrained scientists.Inside, the engineering specialist Victoria noted the amounts of power running through the spire was no enormous there were very few practical uses for it all.

The crew and passengers of the Constantine had succumbed to a neurotoxin produced by Ice Peas while not in it's natural habitat.The USS Sekhmet was sent to investigate the USS Constantine, a Galaxy Class starship itself tasked with transporting an agricultural exchange from the Colony on Re-Alpha to a struggling colony on Bix. Aboard the Sekhmet, a boarding party found the crew of the Constantine acting strangely. The Executive officer ambushed the party, seemingly paranoid that they were intruders. The Captain was engaged in some sort of wrestling tournament, and various other crew members were exhibiting strong emotional reactions.The boarding party found the crew was under the effects of a neurotoxin called Wexylin-5C, which would cause different reactions from each person as a stress response.

When the Sekhmet arrived, it was violently thrown out of warp by a massive subspace distortion wave. With warp-speed rendered impossible and subspace communications completely washed out by background subspace frequencies in the system, they managed to push a probe far enoguh outside the system to get a distress signal out.Next, an away was sent down to Bacchus-3 to investigate the source of the distortion waves. A small coalition team of Starfleet and Klingon officers seemed entranced by the giant monoliths sticking out of the surface of the planet. Soon, the scientists opened the monoliths, revealing a facility on the inside.

They disabled the subspace distortion wave, and evacuated from the planet and the system, bringing wanted Klingon pirates with them.The Sekhmet's away team managed to retrain the remaining survivors on Bacchus-3 before they ran into the spire's interior. Val mind-melded with the science team's vulcan officer, and found a repeating message in his subconscious: \"Find the facility.\" Sorran Vek found that D'Lok, a Klingon, at a brainwave resonating with the subspace distortion frequency.Conrak phasered one of the two phaser arrays guarding the entrance, which activated a security system closing the door. Conrak rushed forward and held the door open while Val disabled the second one. The away team entered the spire, leaving a small security team to guard the restrained scientists.Inside, the engineering specialist Victoria noted the amounts of power running through the spire was no enormous there were very few practical uses for it all. But it was enough power to punch wormholes through space-time. At the center of the spire, the found a control room with consoles for security, power management, subspace field generation, and more. They disabled the security system first, and then turned off the subspace field generator.An automated hologram projection of an alien introduced themselves as representing the \"Displaced.\" The implored the group to find something called \"The Facility\" but didn't know where it was. It said its people were in peril and asked for the away team to go save them. It directed the away to to collect a bread-box sized sandstone prism with runes carved along the outside.The automated messenger finally urged them to leave quickly, because their ship would be in danger. The spires of Bacchus-3 was tractoring the nearest planet towards it, ripping the planet apart as it went. It was rebuilding a new Spire to replace the disabled one. A meteor shower threatened to destroy the Sekhmet and a disabled Klingon vessel.

In the woods, the away team was attacked by 4 panther-like predators, which were then killed or scared away.On the way to the nearest monolith, the away team followed a river until they found a woman and two children by a waterfall. They were doing laundry. Each one looked to be a different species than the others altogether.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.2 - Monoliths.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.2 - Monoliths.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-5.2-monoliths.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 5.2 - Monoliths</a>: Stardate 67255, Session: 7Val, Conrak, Sorren, and Karnes explored Pasqual-1 and followed some locals back to a community built around a black monolith. They discovered that the monolith was performing genetic experiments and forcefully evolving the population, and then attempting to send it to the Seku system. The electromagnetic field seemed to be an unintended interaction of the monoliths and the planet's crust.Val, Conrak, Sorren, and Karnes approached the three locals of Pasqual-1 at the waterfall. After making introductions, Val was able to mind meld with the locals to communicate. The woman introduced herself as Zumala, and the two children were Tadbon and Klopflim. Val hid their true origins from Zumala during the mind meld, but Zumala was able to sense him holding back information.The away team followed the three Pasqualese into their town, and were introduced to their elder, Jasper. Sorren and Val investigated the monolith in the center of town while Conrak aquainted himself with the locals.During a shared dinner outdoors, the monolith lit up in blue lights and 12 people around it fell to the ground, convulsing as it electrocuted. The people of the village seemed worried about it, but expected it to happen.Val convinced Jasper to bring them underneath the monolith, which Jasper considered holy ground. But in the mind meld, Jasper gleaned that the away team with from the stars and interpreted that as the team being angels. He asked them to bring him with them to the stars and Val agreed (at least temporarily.)Underneath the monolith, the away team found a control room. After some investigation, they discovered the control room was attempting to send genetic information from the community out to the Seku system in the Shackleton Expanse. They also found that every 6 months or so, the tower would send a signal out to several members of the community to revise their DNA, and then their children would be born with new features.With this information, the away team decided to return to the transport pickup spot. They brought Jasper, but Jasper was left behind as they were beamed back onto the Sekhmet. The Sekhmet was in red alert, and under attack.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.3 - Vinshari Attack.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.3 - Vinshari Attack.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-5.3-vinshari-attack.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sekhmet Log 5.3 - Vinshari Attack</a>: Stardate 67255, Session: 8When the away team on Pasqual-1 returned to the Sekhmet, it was under attack from a starship crewed by the Vinshari, a new civilization. Conrak and Val were able to work efficiently as a team and quickly disabled the starship. The Vinshari claimed that the Admiral had stolen from them, and demanded the Admiral be handed over to them to face justice. In the end, Admiral Stoker was arrested for attempting to destroy the Vinshari starship while it was defenseless.The away team on Pasqual-1 returned to the USS Sekhmet to find it under attack. Conrak and Val rushed to battle stations on the bridge where Admiral Stoker and Captain Vrenta were keeping things under control so far.The enemy ship was a strange slender design with masts holding up sails. It fired weapons with physical projectiles with surprising effectiveness. Conrak and Val coordinated to return fire quick, dealing some damage to its shields. The Enemy fired a harpoon, which pierced a hole in the shielding and began draining energy from the Sekhmet's hull. Bov organized an emergy response team to dislodge the harpoon.The enemy ship retreated behind the planet and came swinging around the other side, but Conrak and Val were ready for them. Bov diverted Reserve power to the weapons and Conrak disabled their shield. Then Val ordered a torpedo to be fired. Admiral Stoker doubled down on the order and asked for a full salvo of torpedoes, enough to completely obliterate the enemy ship. Conrak did fire a Salvo but intentionally missed with several of the torpedoes.Captain Vrenta stood up against the admiral, saying that firing on a defenseless ship was ground to arrest the Admiral, and that's exactly what happened. Further, the bridge crew from the enemy vessel was beamed onto the Sekhmet and arrested for interrogation. They blood red skin and high collar bones. They called themselves the Vinshari.\n","aliases":["Sekhmet"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Location/Ship"],"headers":[{"heading":"Description","level":1,"id":"Description_0"},{"heading":"Traits","level":2,"id":"Traits_0"},{"heading":"Namesake","level":2,"id":"Namesake_0"},{"heading":"Mission","level":2,"id":"Mission_0"},{"heading":"Mission
