Note:: Pulled back into service to supplement Starfleet's overextended fleet, the USS Sekhmet stands on guard over Narendra station and the Shackleton Expanse beyond.
The USS Sekmet is a Columbia Class cruiser stationed at Narendra Station. After the bombings on the Mars Utopia Planitia shipyards, Starfleet supplemented it's fleet by pulling retired vessels back into service with substantial refits. The Sekhmet carries a crew of a little over 100 crewman and officers.

Next, an away was sent down to Bacchus-3 to investigate the source of the distortion waves.

Conrak rushed forward and held the door open while Val disabled the second one. The away team entered the spire, leaving a small security team to guard the restrained scientists.Inside, the engineering specialist Victoria noted the amounts of power running through the spire was no enormous there were very few practical uses for it all. But it was enough power to punch wormholes through space-time. At the center of the spire, the found a control room with consoles for security, power management, subspace field generation, and more. They disabled the security system first, and then turned off the subspace field generator.An automated hologram projection of an alien introduced themselves as representing the "Displaced."

A meteor shower threatened to destroy the Sekhmet and a disabled Klingon vessel. The away team and others on the surface returned to the Sekhmet.The Klingon vessel had arrived to find their "compatriots", and demanded to have them returned. Val convinced the Klingons that if they allowed the Sekhmet to tractor them out of the system to safety, then the fugitives would be returned, with an implication that they would be set free.However, the commanding officer Vrenta Ewasi instead ordered the Sekhmet to rendezvous with Starfleet vessels answering a distress signal.

The Captain was engaged in some sort of wrestling tournament, and various other crew members were exhibiting strong emotional reactions.The boarding party found the crew was under the effects of a neurotoxin called Wexylin-5C, which would cause different reactions from each person as a stress response. They tracked down the source of this neurotoxin to a plan on board called Ice Peas. The colonists had brought the crop on board and were sharing the food with the crew.

The artifact could not be located on the station, and only 2 starships had left Narendra Station recently.The Sekhmet started by chasing down a Klingon Bird of Prey, who turned out to be innocent. This mistake meant an Orion Freighter made it all the way to the Romulan Neutral Zone before the Sekhmet caught up. In the neutral zone, they found the back end of the freighter caved in like an aluminum can, with some kind of gravity field compressing the ship's hull.Lt. Commander Val ordered the freighter to be hulled away with a tractor beam, but in the same moment a Romulan decloaked and caught the freighter in it's own tractor beam. This lead to a brief firefight. The Sekhmet disabled the Orion freighters shields and beamed the artifact aboard. The artifact was still attached to an Orion via a telepathic link which would kill him if removed forcefully.The the Orion freighter captain, Paljara, begged Val to send the artifact back, as it was ransom for her sister's life. Val refused to comply. The Romulan captain also threatened the Sekhmet, warning of dire consequences if the artifact and the Orion were not returned.In the end, the Sekhmet managed to charge it's warp drive and race back to Narendra station.

However, the artifact's signal overloaded the failsafe meant to protect Val. It was deemed unsafe to continue these kinds of investigations.
A shuttle was found rushing out of the Shackleton Expanse and towards the Sekhmet. Admiral Stoker was aboard and had taken damage as if in a firefight. When she boarded, she ordered the Sekhmet to head towards the Pasqual system in the Shackleton. Investigation into the shuttle revealed that she had indeed gotten into a fight with an unknown civilization. Her shuttle had visited several systems in the Shackleton.After cleaning up, Stoker briefed the crew on their mission: Pasqual-1 was an M-Class planet with a strange electromagnetic field shielding it from sensors. Stoker expected this planet might have remnants from the same civilization as Bacchus. The crew was also to keep a lookout for enemy ships that may have followed Stoker's shuttleAfter the briefing, Stoker took Conrak and Val aside and made it clear that the civilian Hik was to be enlisted into the Starfleet command structure or be removed from the ship's crew. Hik would be given a suitable position for her experience.The Sekhmet arrived at Pasqual-1 and found it covered in approximately 500 black obsidian monoliths, each about 3 stories tall. Each one had a small settlement build around it from a pre-industrial civilization.The Sekhmet put together an away team for Pasqual-1, and beamed down even through the electromagnetic interference. They aimed several kilometers outside a settlement and intended to work their way in to investigate the monolith there.

After making introductions, Val was able to mind meld with the locals to communicate. The woman introduced herself as Zumala, and the two children were Tadbon and Klopflim. Val hid their true origins from Zumala during the mind meld, but Zumala was able to sense him holding back information.The away team followed the three Pasqualese into their town, and were introduced to their elder, Jasper. Sorren and Val investigated the monolith in the center of town while Conrak acquainted himself with the locals.During a shared dinner outdoors, the monolith lit up in blue lights and 12 people around it fell to the ground, convulsing as it electrocuted. The people of the village seemed worried about it, but expected it to happen.Val convinced Jasper to bring them underneath the monolith, which Jasper considered holy ground. But in the mind meld, Jasper gleaned that the away team with from the stars and interpreted that as the team being angels. He asked them to bring him with them to the stars and Val agreed (at least temporarily.)Underneath the monolith, the away team found a control room. After some investigation, they discovered the control room was attempting to send genetic information from the community out to the Seku system in the Shackleton Expanse. They also found that every 6 months or so, the tower would send a signal out to several members of the community to revise their DNA, and then their children would be born with new features.With this information, the away team decided to return to the transport pickup spot. They brought Jasper, but Jasper was left behind as they were beamed back onto the Sekhmet. The Sekhmet was in red alert, and under attack.]]></description><link>mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-5.2-monoliths.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 5.2 - Monoliths.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:22:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sekhmet Log 5.3 - Vinshari Attack]]></title><description><![CDATA[Table5 resultsSort0Filter0PropertiesNewCharactersTypeNon-Player CharacterTypePlayer CharacterTypeSupporting CharacterThe away team on Pasqual-1 returned to the USS Sekhmet to find it under attack. Conrak and Val rushed to battle stations on the bridge where Admiral Stoker and Captain Vrenta were keeping things under control so far.The enemy ship was a strange slender design with masts holding up sails. It fired weapons with physical projectiles with surprising effectiveness. Conrak and Val coordinated to return fire quick, dealing some damage to its shields. The Enemy fired a harpoon, which pierced a hole in the shielding and began draining energy from the Sekhmet's hull. Bov organized an emergy response team to dislodge the harpoon.The enemy ship retreated behind the planet and came swinging around the other side, but Conrak and Val were ready for them. Bov diverted Reserve power to the weapons and Conrak disabled their shield. Then Val ordered a torpedo to be fired. Admiral Stoker doubled down on the order and asked for a full salvo of torpedoes, enough to completely obliterate the enemy ship. Conrak did fire a Salvo but intentionally missed with several of the torpedoes.Captain Vrenta stood up against the admiral, saying that firing on a defenseless ship was ground to arrest the Admiral, and that's exactly what happened. Further, the bridge crew from the enemy vessel was beamed onto the Sekhmet and arrested for interrogation. They had blood red skin and high collar bones.

Most of the other guests were invited by Halgrave for his supposed birthday party. But Allied intelligence suspected the party was cover for an auction.At the party, Halgrave was no where to be seen. But the crew met with several would-be buyers at the auction. Val spoke with some of the guests along with Bov and Relek Tovan, trying to guess what Stoker's intention was.

They were currently doing a sweep along the Romulan Neutral Zone.Before the Sekhmet could arrive, the Nightingale unexpectedly veered into the neutral zone. They were attacked by a Romulan Warbird, which disabled the ship and killed half their crew, with another 25% severely injured.However, the Romulans claimed to have taken a hit to their shields and were performing repairs before they would take the Nightingale and its crew as prisoners of war.The Sekhmet arrived and managed to disguise it's arrival in a nebula. From here they observed the scene. The Romulan Warbird was not truly damaged. The Sekhmet's crew assumed the Romulans may be recovering an agent or or asset.The Sekhmet launched a surprise attack against the Warbird, and managed to truly disable it's shields with a torpedo salvo and then move into a position to protect the Nightingale. The Warbird attempted to defend itself and repair it's shields, but it was too late.In the middle of the fight, a shuttle departed from the Nightingale careening towards the Warbird. It moved fast enough that the Sekhmet was unable to capture it in a tractor beam, and retreated into the wings of the Warbird. With no other way to stop the shuttle and fears that critical information could get into Romulan hands, the Sekhmet fired upon the shuttle itself destroying it and killing it's only crew member.The Romulan Warbird hailed the Sekhmet and said its goodbyes. It was none other than Sub-Commander Thal'vaek.With the Romulans taken care of, the Sekhmet performed basic repairs and relief for the survivors on the Nightingale. Their computers had been disabled by their captain using the Romulan Protocal, and a supposed Vulcan Starfleet Lieutenant named T'Lek had been working to restore them to assist with repairs. However, soon after computers were back online, during the fight, the T'Lek took the shuttle to the Romulans. It's currently unknown what intel T'Lek intended to give to Thal'vaek.]]></description><link>mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-7-border-dispute.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 7 - Border Dispute.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:22:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sekhmet Log 8 - Order in Court]]></title><description><![CDATA[Table6 resultsSort0Filter0PropertiesNewCharactersTypeNon-Player CharacterTypePlayer CharacterTypeSupporting Character

The black hole's radiation jets were rotating to align with the galactic plane, threatening any number of systems within 100 light years. Long range scans estimate that the rotation started just a few weeks ago.In the system, they found the neutronium space station, the black hole, and a single barren planet with 300 life signs on it. They also found a Vinshari ship with a skeleton crew in the system, and chased it away. One away team went to the only planet in the system, and another went to the neutronium station, suspecting that the station may be controlling the wormhole.On the planet, the away team met a species called the Ithik, who seemed to worship the black hole, awaiting the day that it would "turn it's gaze towards them. They were interpreting the rotation of the radiation jets of their final rapture. They away team was shown the Ithik meditation chambers, The Sekhmet team discovered signs of extreme danger and turned their focus to the station orbiting nearby.The station's away team headed first to engineering, where they found a suite of singularity engines powering the station’s systems. Most of the output was being funneled into controlling the black hole itself, but subsystems also supported wormhole generation, advanced security, and a vast cloning facility. To prioritize recovery efforts, the crew diverted energy away from security and into the cloning bays, activating approximately 300 stasis pods on the station.The team then moved to the control room, where they found Vinshari operatives already inside, presumably attempting to seize the station’s technology. This set the stage for a confrontation over control of the station and its powerful systems, while the greater danger of the black hole’s shifting radiation remained unresolved.]]></description><link>mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-9.1-abyss-station.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 9.1 - -Abyss Station.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:22:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sekhmet Log 9.2 - Chaktir]]></title><description><![CDATA[Table4 resultsSort0Filter0PropertiesNewCharactersTypePlayer CharacterTypeSupporting CharacterThe USS Sekhmet continued its mission in the Omega Draconis system, focusing on both the neutronium station and the Ithik colony on Chaktir. On the station, the away team staged an ambush around the control room, surrounding the Vinshari from multiple angles and catching them by surprise. Lt. Conrac led the charge, using his Numgo Teeka bostaff-like weapon to knock out most of the Vinshari singlehandedly. Their leader, a woman wielding holo-emitter batons, created illusions and false walls before trapping herself in a force field once her team was defeated.With the control room secured, the team analyzed the station’s systems further and confirmed that its technology was producing successive generations of the Ithik people living on Chaktir. Meanwhile, on the planet, the away team worked to convince the Ithik to evacuate ahead of the black hole’s shifting radiation jets. Through Minister Temeran, they framed the event as a divine punishment rather than an ascension, sowing doubt in the religious prophecy. While Temeran and Gengi began to waver, the Minister of Astronomy remained unconvinced.Elsewhere, Commander Val experienced a strange compulsion to seek out "The Facility", eventually visiting Minister Vodlin, the Minister of Wellbeing. They offered an infusion of Ithik nanoprobes, so Val submerged in a tank of nanite-rich gel, resisting multiple attempts by the swarm to seize control of his body and mind. Val emerged transformed but stable. The away team prepared for a final confrontation with Mayor Akkara, with only limited time remaining to convince him to evacuate his people before the black hole’s radiation surge reached the planet.]]></description><link>mission-logs/missions/sekhmet-log-9.2-chaktir.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Sekhmet/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Sekhmet Log 9.2 - Chaktir.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:22:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sekhmet Log 9.3 - When the Abyss Looked Away]]></title><description><![CDATA[Table6 resultsSort0Filter0PropertiesNewCharactersTypePlayer CharacterTypeSupporting CharacterThe crew of the Sekhmet failed to convince the Ithik people of Chaktir to evacuate.

Enraged, he sealed the shuttle bay and tried to trap the away team.The crew managed to beam out the shuttle and themselves simultaneously to avoid cultural contamination. As the Ithik watched the golden transporter beam, they believed the visitors were ascending and Akkara leapt into the beam. Once aboard the Sekhmet, he begged to stay, shaken by the collapse of his faith. The crew decided returning him would cause more harm than good, and allowed him to remain aboard.Before leaving the system, the crew installed a tripwire in the station’s shuttle bay.

Vrenta Ewasi interviewed Tennan Li and questioned him about his demotion. He also gave Val Permission to further investigate the Bacchus Artifact on the condition that Daoloth be able to supervise.To study the artifact, they constructed a telepathic field scanner to analyze the object’s field emissions. The device returned a simple message: “Hello? Is anyone there?” A containment system was quickly established by adding a telepathic barrier to isolate the artifact’s influence.Later, Narendra Station prepared an escort mission through a region filled with subspace eddies. A convoy of federation civilian colonization transports required safe passage, and the Klingon Defense Force committed a bird-of-prey to assist.Halfway to their destination, the Bird of Prey was disabled by a subspace eddie that overloaded its nacelle. As a repair team with Daoloth, Tovan, Val, and Sklarr made way in a shuttle to the bird of prey, two Vinshari Maelstrom starships appeared as if from no where and deployed a dozen single fighter ships.

The trail led to the Amaddon system, where the crew observed two Ha’kiv—massive space slugs—feeding in a gas giant’s upper atmosphere. Moments later, two large Vinshari ships arrived, harpooned a Ha’kiv like whalers, and hailed the Sekhmet demanding its warp core, claiming “energy is our right.”The Sekhmet refused, ducked behind a planet, and tuned defenses: hull polarization and shield recalibration to blunt Vinshari fire.
